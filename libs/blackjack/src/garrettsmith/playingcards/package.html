<p>
Provides basic classes for simulating a game that uses playing cards.
</p>
<p>
While Plaingcards was designed to be flexible enough to support any card game,
it was implemented only with the features needed to simulate a game of
Blackjack.  For example, the package provides only minimal support for jokers
because Blackjack does not require them.
</p>
<p>
<code>Card</code> is an immutable object that represents a single card.  
<code>CardContainer</code> and <code>CardList</code> types provide logical
aggregations of cards.
</p>
<p>
<code>Deck</code> provides for an arbitrary type distribution of cards.
Blackjack requires a standard deck of cards with no jokers.  Some types of
poker use jokers.  Pinochle, for example, uses an altogether different type of deck.  
If you require a different type of deck, provide a new <code>Deck</code> implementation
and use it with <code>CardContainer</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>CardContainer</code> provides for shuffling and distributing
an arbitrary type distribution and number of decks.
