<p>
Provides classes for playing a game of blackjack.
</p>
<p>
Implement {@link garrettsmith.blackjack.EventHandler} to respond to events that a fired by
{@link garrettsmith.blackjack.Blackjack}.  Then, pass in an instance of that handler to
{@link garrettsmith.blackjack.Blackjack#playGame}.
</p>
<p>
For example:
<pre>
        double wager = 2.0;
        Blackjack blackjack = new Blackjack();
        EventHandler handler = new MyEventHandler();
        blackjack.playGame( handler, wager );
</pre>
</p>
<p>
See {@link garrettsmith.blackjack.refimpl.TextPlayer} for an example implementation.
